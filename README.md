### Hi I am Amitabh Das ðŸ‘‹

#### An IT professional, working on different cool technology like cloud, Kubernetes, devops, virtualization, networks. On my free time I love to build small projects and hands-on lab for my self-learning. I am not a smart computer programmer but always try to write a piece of code by gathering information from different sources. I like to finish my day by learning at least one new thing about tech, life, investing etc.
